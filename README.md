## RAFAEL RASSE
## General topic of research
Biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen in the main Earthâ€™s reservoirs 

## Major topic of interest
INvestigation the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen in oxygen minimum zones (OMZs)  and anoxic basins by merging conventional and ground-breaking approaches of quantification.

## Principal career goal
My main career ambition is contributing to unravel the key set of mechanisms that drive the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen in  world OMZs to ultimately contribute to refine their mechanistic predictions.
