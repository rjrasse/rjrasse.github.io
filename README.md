#### Integrative Perspective of the Biogeochemical Cycles
> <div style="text-align: justify"> I am a chemist with pluridisciplinary skills, who holds a PhD in Chemistry (Earth Science), a Postgraduate Certificate in Ocean Observatories. My solid multidisciplinary background and skills allow me to have a wide understanding, and an exceptional integrative view regarding: (1) how several mechanisms concurrently drive the biogeochemical cycles of key elements in the main reservoirs of the planet (i.e. atmosphere, land, ocean and rivers), and (2) how such cycles are interconnected within (and between) the reservoirs and partially drive the Earth’s climate, and (3) identify key biogeochemical knowledge gaps and ultimately propose novel solutions to fill them by combining traditional and ground-breaking cross-disciplinary approaches particularly in the tropical oceans poorly oxygenated. </div>

#### General Topic of Research ####
> <div style="text-align: justify"> Investigating the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen in the main Earth’s reservoirs by combining conventional and revolutionary approaches of quantification. </div>

#### Career Goal
> <div style="text-align: justify"> Contributing to unravel the key set of mechanisms that concurrently modulate the carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen cycles in OMZs and anoxic basins to ultimately contribute to refine their mechanistic predictions. </div>

   -	Using CTD-rosette to study the biogeochemical and optical characteristics of the surface and mesopelagic layer of the ocean.
   	
 ***Atmosphere***. Applicating high volume cascade impactor, only-wet deposition sampler, meteorological station, and satellite products (i.e. backward air-masses trajectories) to investigate.

#### Deployment of biogeochemical (BGC) Argo floats, field work, and cruise expeditions ####
> <div style="text-align: justify"> Since the begging of my career, I have been leading and participating in field works to investigate biogeochemical cycles in the main reservoirs of the planet (i.e. land, ocean, rivers, and atmosphere) from local, regional, and global scales and over a continuum of time scales (from days to years). More recently, I have been involved in the deployment of BGC-Argo floats.</div>   

***Deployment of BGC-Argo floats in the tropical OMZs***
> <div style="text-align: justify"> Since 2014, I have been directly involved in coordinating the deployment of the first BGC-Argo floats in the OMZs of the eastern tropical north Atlantic and north Pacific. More recently (2020), I have deployed the first float attached with an UVP and an array of sensors that will allow me to generate key information regarding how diverse mechanisms modulate the cycles of C, O, and N. </div>

-	Bermuda Atlantic Time series (BATS,  30 days)
Activities.(1) Processing sampling for the analysis of biogeochemical parameters, and active participation in the deployment of deep sea mooring.(2) short intensive independent project (~ 3 month), where I have designed in collaboration with Dr. Michael Lomas, a bioassay experiment to investigate the effect of ocean acidification in the Redfield ratio. For this purpose, I have used conventional methods to collect, process, and quantify biogeochemical variables (i.e. alkalinity and carbonate chemistry, chlorophyll-a, nutrients (NO3- and PO4+, and POM). M. Lomas and collaborators used this preliminary data set as part of a project submitted to the National Science Foundation, USA (Source: Gerry Plumley, Director of CoE-NF POGO programme at BIOS).
